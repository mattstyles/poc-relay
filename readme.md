# getting-started-github

Create a github token in order to access the github api (itâ€™ll need repo access) and add it to `.env.example`. Rename to `.env`.

The relay script also requires [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) to be installed.

```sh
yarn
yarn start
yarn run relay
```

Start will begin a server ready to serve your project to browsers. The relay script will start watching your queries and converting them into something that relay can use.
